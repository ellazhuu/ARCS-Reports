# Activities

* tried to ls into Prof Clark's directory but couldn't find it for some reason, I could ls to see what was inside data and clark but I couldn't see anything specifically inside scr2023 (Daisy helped me fix this issue later by suggesting I use the apple terminal instead of iterms) 
* was busy this week so didn't do much (I'm writing this late but I've documented my work after oct 2nd on the report for next week)
