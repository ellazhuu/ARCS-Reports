# Activities

* worked on the plot_confusion_matrix function so that it downloads an image of the confusion plot: 
  * copied the source code from fastai and adjusted it to work with validation code 
  * downloaded the image to the current directory 
  * uploaded the image onto wandb (appears under charts in specific runs) 
  * two variations uploaded: one as the raw data, the other as the normalized version (normalized across rows) 
  * example of matrix (under run RealImagesInference in Testing Work Flow)

* QUESTION: what should we do to generate similiar visuals for the inference file since the accuracy and labling is a little different 

* tried to fix the pkl path vs pth path in training.py:
  * tried fixing/playing around with the code here:

# Plans: 
* look into generating heat maps with Liz and Daisy
* find visual metric to generate for inference file
* look into gym environment and start intergrating into boxnav
