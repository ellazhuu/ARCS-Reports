# Activities

* Logged onto the lab machines to document the data collection process with boxnav 
  * Documentation docs [incomplete] : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wy34CYq86Lyog5vW71g_iOvLiwP9dbAky90xRMbgAS0/edit?usp=sharing
  * We noticed that conda was not installed on the lab computers so following directions from here: https://compusciencing.github.io/windows-setup.html. 
  * Specifically: we opened powershell 7 (the most updated one) and ran this command: D:\Programs\Mambaforge\shell\condabin\conda-hook.ps1
    * This is the path to where the conda hook is in the computer 
  * There was no conda environments on the machine so i made a new environment but I'm not sure if its local or global. 

* Updated training.py and inference.py with code to make it more compatible with wandb:
