# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 10/30  | Group meeting with Clark, quickly summerized what everyone's been doing 
| 11/01  | Met with Daisy, Liz and Chau to confirm naming conventions and work on plotting top loss in validation.py


# Activities

* Confirmed naming convention for training datasets, (also written on the Lab doc): 
  * F"{wandb_name}-{model_arch}-{dataset_name}-rep{rep:02}-{pre-trained?}-{pytorch_version}.pkl"

* Tried to plot the top loss function in validation.py but couldn't figure it out: 
  * We looked into the plot_top_losses documented here: https://docs.fast.ai/interpret.html#interpretation.plot_top_losses (at interpretation.plot_top_losses) but the function didn't return anything and seemed incomplete 
    * We think it was meant to be used on a platform like Jupyter notebook where it could simply be visualized, but it isn't saved anything 
  * Then, in search of a better alternative, we found classification.interpretation.plot_top_losses, which also included a lot more functionalities (like generated heat maps on top losses) 
    * This function is documented here: https://github.com/fastai/fastai1/blob/master/fastai/vision/interpret.py
    * When we tried to run this function, the program seemed to revert back to the interpretation plot_top_loss function (the one with less functionality), hence a lot of the parameters we put was returning error statements 
  * We realized that classification.interpretation.plot_top_loss is from fastai v1 while the first one we looked at is from v2 -> v1 has been discontinued so it doesn't work anymore (big rip)
  * We tried to copy the code from fastai v1 so that we're able to save the visual and have heatmaps for top losses but the code imported a lot of different functions from many different fastai files and it ended up requiring too much copy pasting
  * We gave up after trying for a while and switched tactics to trying to change the plot_top_losses from v1 so that we're able to save the visual 
    * We ran into a similar problem where a lot of the functions were defined in other fastai files so it was a lot of searching and copying again 
  * And then we gave up :( 

# Plans: 
* Potentially write our own code for calculating top loss and generating the visual so that we're able to save it (or look for other premade functions that are easier to navigate than fastai)
