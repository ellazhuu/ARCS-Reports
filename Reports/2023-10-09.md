| 10/04  | worked with Daisy to download the Do Well dataset and exported models onto wandb 

# Activities

* learned how to use the remote SSH extention on VS code from daisy:
  * go to remote explorer and paste in ID: jzzo2022@pom-itb-dgx01.campus.pomona.edu
  * enter password
  * use file on the upper menu to navigate through different files on the server 
* created a new folder on the server titled testdowell1. in that folder, i created a new conda environment called wandb. 
* created sub folders inside testdowell1 and downloaded the dataset from wandb into the subfolders (the downloaded data is on the left, the code we used is on the right):

* for download.py: change link in run.use_artifact according to which artifact to download and also update download_dir accordingly
* while trying to download the dataset, we ran into a lot of problems trying to import/download wandb onto the conda environment
  * command i used: python3 -m pip install wandb
* downloaded all four datasets from the Do Well project on wandb onto the server folder
* exported three models onto wandb with Daisy
  * for training.py: update the link for artifact = run.use_artifact() each time
  * we ran into some issues with downloading torch and fastai onto the conda environment (commands used: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio and pip install fastai)
* the models for perfect static and wandering static are in Do-Well-Model
